Hey Guys! Thanks for checking out this project. 

This app allows a user to submit fields to an external API and displays a success message after submission.

The form will not allow for submission if the fields are entered incorrectly. 

Below is a link to the project and a video that explains the project in more detail. Thanks for reading!
